# LIRI

LIRI stands for "Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface." LIRI is a command-line node app that takes in a command and a subject for the command, and returns the relevant data. [Video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zG0i-2-SF-WUKr3wccHwCaitBPmbrcwM/view?usp=sharing).

## How to use LIRI:

Type a command and a subject for the command into the command-line.

### Commands:

- **spotify-this-song:** When followed by a song title, this command will return the name of the artist, the song title, a preview link, and the name of the album the song is from.
- **concert-this:** When followed by a band or artist, this command will return information for that band or artist's next performance - name of the venue, city, region/state, and country followed by the date of the show.
- **movie-this:** When followed by the title of a movie, this command will return the movie title, the year of release, the MPAA rating, the IMDB rating, the Rotten Tomatoes rating, the country where the movie was produced, the language of the movie, the plot, and the actors in the film.
- **do-what-it-says:** runs whatever command and subject are written in "random.txt."

LIRI was created as part of a homework assignment for UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It was created by [Sergio Di Martino](https://webdevserg.io). Any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding LIRI should be directed to [Sergio](mailto:sergio@webdevserg.io).
